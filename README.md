# 🤖 AI Conversational RAG Chatbot (Flowise)

This project is a **Conversational AI chatbot built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with Flowise.  
The chatbot can answer questions from uploaded documents by retrieving relevant context and generating accurate responses using an LLM.

It combines **document retrieval, embeddings, vector search, and conversational memory** to provide context-aware responses.

---

# 🚀 Project Overview

This chatbot uses a **RAG pipeline** where documents are loaded, split into chunks, converted into embeddings, stored in a vector database, and then retrieved during conversation to generate answers.

The system allows users to ask questions related to the uploaded documents while maintaining conversation history.

---

# 🧠 Architecture

The system workflow follows these steps:

1. **Document Loading**
   - Documents are loaded using the File Loader node.

2. **Text Splitting**
   - Documents are divided into smaller chunks using Recursive Character Text Splitter.

3. **Embedding Generation**
   - Each chunk is converted into vector embeddings using Google Gemini Embeddings.

4. **Vector Storage**
   - Embeddings are stored in an In-Memory Vector Store.

5. **Retrieval**
   - Relevant document chunks are retrieved based on user queries.

6. **Response Generation**
   - The Mistral LLM generates answers using retrieved context.

7. **Conversation Memory**
   - Buffer Memory stores chat history to maintain conversation continuity.

# 🏗 System Components

### 1️⃣ File Loader
Loads documents such as PDFs or other supported files.

### 2️⃣ Recursive Character Text Splitter
Splits documents into smaller chunks for better embedding and retrieval.

### 3️⃣ Google Gemini Embeddings
Generates vector embeddings for document chunks.

### 4️⃣ In-Memory Vector Store
Stores embeddings and retrieves the most relevant chunks during queries.

### 5️⃣ Mistral AI Chat Model
Generates responses using retrieved document context.

### 6️⃣ Buffer Memory
Stores conversation history to maintain context across interactions.

### 7️⃣ Conversational Retrieval QA Chain
Combines retrieval + LLM + memory to produce contextual answers.
